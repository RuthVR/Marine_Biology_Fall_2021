# Marine_Biology_Fall_2021

In this repo I will be working on cleaning up data and analyzing data for the group project. My group and I will be looking at how the temperature of the seawater in the northeastern part of Australia. We got our data from https://portal.aodn.org.au/search and we choose to get data for phytoplankton and zooplankton abundancies. Packages used in the analysis were "janitor", "tidyverse", "dplyr", and "ggplot2". Color pallates used on the plots came from "ggsci".
